# Using AWS CloudTrail to Identify Amazon S3 Signature Version 2 Requests<a name="cloudtrail-identification-sigV2"></a>

Amazon S3 now lets you identify what API signature version was used to sign a request using an AWS CloudTrail event log\. This capability is important because support for Signature Version 2 will be turned off \(deprecated\)\. After that , Amazon S3 will no longer accept requests that use Signature Version 2, and all requests must use *Signature Version 4* signing\.  

We strongly recommend that you use CloudTrail to help determine whether any of your workflows are using Signature Version 2 signing\. Remediate them by upgrading your libraries and code to use Signature Version 4 instead to prevent any impact to your business\. 

For more information, see [Announcement: AWS CloudTrail for Amazon S3 adds new fields for enhanced security auditing](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=6551) in the AWS Discussion Forums\.

If you are using Amazon S3 server access logs, see [ Using Amazon S3 Access Logs to Identify Signature Version 2 Requests ](using-s3-access-logs-to-idenitfy-sigv2-requests.md)\.

## How CloudTrail Captures Requests Made to Amazon S3<a name="cloudtrail-logging-s3-sigv2"></a>

By default, CloudTrail logs S3 bucket\-level API calls that were made in the last 90 days, but not log requests made to objects\. Bucket\-level calls include events like `CreateBucket`, `DeleteBucket`, `PutBucketLifeCycle`, `PutBucketPolicy`, etc\. You can see bucket\-level events on the CloudTrail console\. However, you can't view data events \(Amazon S3 object\-level calls\) thereâ€”you must parse or query CloudTrail logs for them\. CloudTrail events for Amazon S3 include the signature version in the request details under the key name of '`additionalEventData`'\. To find the signature version on requests made for objects in Amazon S3 like GETs, PUTs, and DELETEs, you must enable CloudTrail data events because it is turned off by default\. 

For information about what Amazon S3 API calls are captured by CloudTrail, see [Amazon S3 Information in CloudTrail](cloudtrail-logging.md#cloudtrail-logging-s3-info)\. 

## Enabling CloudTrail Event Logging for S3 Buckets and Objects<a name="enable-cloudtrail-logging-for-s3"></a>

To enable CloudTrail data events for a specific bucket, see [How Do I Enable Object\-Level Logging for an S3 Bucket with AWS CloudTrail Data Events?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/enable-cloudtrail-events.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide*\.

To enable CloudTrail data events for all your buckets or for a list of specific buckets, you must [create a trail manually in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.html)\. 

**Note**  
 With an S3 bucket that is generating a high workload, you could quickly generate thousands of logs in a short amount of time\. Be mindful of how long you choose to enable CloudTrail data events for a busy bucket\. 

 CloudTrail stores Amazon S3 data event logs in an S3 bucket of your choosing\. For organizational purposes, you might consider using a bucket in a separate AWS account to hold them\. Using AWS Organizations, you can create an AWS account that is linked to your own account\. For more information, see [What Is AWS Organizations?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*

When you create a trail in CloudTrail, in the data events section, you can select the **Select all S3 buckets in your account** check box to log all object level events\. 

## Identifying Requests Made to Amazon S3 Using Signature Version 2 in a CloudTrail Log<a name="identify-S3-requests-using-sigv2"></a>

Events logged by CloudTrail are stored in a compressed gzipped JSON object in your S3 bucket\. To efficiently find Signature Version 2 requests, you should use a service like Amazon Athena to index and query the CloudTrail logs\. For more information about CloudTrail and Athena, see [Querying AWS CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.html)\. 

### Using Athena<a name="using-athena"></a>

After you set up CloudTrail to deliver events to a bucket, you should start to see objects go to your destination bucket on the Amazon S3 console\. These are formatted as follows: `s3://<myawsexamplebucket>/AWSLogs/<111122223333>/CloudTrail/<Region>/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>` 

**Example CloudTrail event logs**  

Consider the following example:

`s3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/us-east-2/2019/04/14`

With these event logs, you can now create an Athena database and table to query them as follows:

1. Open the Athena console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home)\.

1. Change the AWS Region to be the same as your CloudTrail destination S3 bucket\.

1. In the query window, create an Athena database for your CloudTrail events:

   ```
   CREATE DATABASE s3_cloudtrail_events_db
   ```

1. Use the following query to create a table for all of your CloudTrail events in the bucket\. Be sure to change the bucket name from *<CloudTrail\_myawsexamplebucket>* to your bucket's name\. Also provide the *AWS\_account\_ID* CloudTrail that is used in your bucket\. 

   ```
   CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table(
                       eventversion STRING,
                       useridentity STRUCT<
                           type:STRING,
                           principalid:STRING,
                           arn:STRING,

                           accesskeyid:STRING,
                           userName:STRING,
                           sessioncontext:STRUCT<

                                       sessionissuer:STRUCT<  
                                       type:STRING,
                                       principalId:STRING,
                                       arn:STRING, 
                                       accountId:STRING,
                                       userName:STRING>
                               >
                            >,
                       eventtime STRING,
                       eventsource STRING,

                       errormessage STRING,
                       requestparameters STRING,
                       responseelements STRING,
                       additionaleventdata STRING,

                           accountId:STRING,
                           type:STRING>>,

                       sharedeventid STRING,
                       vpcendpointid STRING
                   )
                   ROW FORMAT SERDE 'com.amazon.emr.hive.serde.CloudTrailSerde'
                   STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'com.amazon.emr.cloudtrail.CloudTrailInputFormat'
                   OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'
                   LOCATION 's3://<myawsexamplebucket>/AWSLogs/<111122223333>/';
   ```

1. Test Athena to ensure that the query works\.

   ```
                           SELECT * FROM s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table
                           WHERE eventsource='s3.amazonaws.com'
                           LIMIT 2;
   ```

### Athena Queries<a name="athena-queries"></a>

**Example Athena query: Select all events that are Signature Version 2 or end in 403s, print all columns, and limit it to five results**  
In the following query, replace *<s3\_cloudtrail\_events\_db\.cloudtrail\_myawsexamplebucket\_table>*, and remove the limit as needed\.   

```
                    SELECT *
                    FROM <s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table>
                    WHERE eventsource='s3.amazonaws.com'
                    AND json_extract_scalar(additionalEventData, '$.SignatureVersion')!='SigV4'
                    LIMIT 5;
```
+ The "`useragent`" column identifies the client that the requester is using that made a Signature Version 2 request\.
+ The "`additionaleventdata`" column has entries of `"SignatureVersion":"SigV2"`\.

**Example Athena query: Select all events that are Signature Version 2 and print only EventTime, S3 Action, Request\_Parameters, Region, SourceIP, and UserAgent**  
In the following query, replace *<s3\_cloudtrail\_events\_db\.cloudtrail\_myawsexamplebucket\_table>* with your Athena details and increase or remove the limit as needed\.   

```
                    SELECT EventTime, EventName as S3_Action, requestParameters as Request_Parameters, awsregion as AWS_Region, sourceipaddress as Source_IP, useragent as User_Agent
                    FROM s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table
                    WHERE eventsource='s3.amazonaws.com'
                    AND json_extract_scalar(additionalEventData, '$.SignatureVersion')='SigV2'
                    LIMIT 10;
```

**Example Athena query: Select all Signature Version 2 requests**  

```
                    SELECT * 
                    FROM s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table
                    WHERE eventsource='s3.amazonaws.com'
                    AND json_extract_scalar(additionalEventData, '$.SignatureVersion')='SigV2'
```

**Example Athena query: Select all requesters that are sending Signature Version 2 traffic**  

```
                    SELECT useridentity.arn, Count(requestid) as RequestCount
                    FROM s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table
                    WHERE eventsource='s3.amazonaws.com'
                        and json_extract_scalar(additionalEventData, '$.SignatureVersion')='SigV2'
                    Group by useridentity.arn
```

**Example Athena query: Select all source IP addresses that are sending Signature Version 2 traffic**  

```
                    SELECT sourceIPAddress, Count(requestid) as RequestCount
                    FROM s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table
                    WHERE eventsource='s3.amazonaws.com'
                        and json_extract_scalar(additionalEventData, '$.SignatureVersion')='SigV2'
                    Group by sourceIPAddress
```

**Note**  
It's a best practice to [create an Amazon S3 lifecycle policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html) for your server access logs bucket\. Configure the lifecycle policy to periodically remove log files\. Doing so reduces the amount of data that Athena analyzes for each query\.
For information about logging format, see [Logging Amazon S3 API Calls by Using AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudtrail-logging.html)\.
For examples of how to query CloudTrail logs, see [Analyze Security, Compliance, and Operational Activity Using AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Athena](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/aws-cloudtrail-and-amazon-athena-dive-deep-to-analyze-security-compliance-and-operational-activity/)\. 

### Partitioning Signature Version 2 Data<a name="partitioning-sigv2-data"></a>

If you have a large amount of data that you need to query, you can reduce the costs and runtime of Athena by creating a partitioned table\. 

To do this, create a new table with partitions as follows\.

```
                   CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table_partitioned(
                        eventversion STRING,
                        userIdentity STRUCT<
                            type:STRING,
                            principalid:STRING,
                            arn:STRING,
                            accountid:STRING,
                            invokedby:STRING,
                            accesskeyid:STRING,
                            userName:STRING,
                         sessioncontext:STRUCT<
                                    attributes:STRUCT< 
                                    mfaauthenticated:STRING,
                                    creationdate:STRING>,
                                    sessionIssuer:STRUCT<
                                    type:STRING,
                                    principalId:STRING,
                                    arn:STRING,
                                    accountId:STRING,
                                    userName:STRING>
                                >
                             >,
                        eventTime STRING,
                        eventSource STRING,
                        eventName STRING,
                        awsRegion STRING,
                        sourceIpAddress STRING,
                        userAgent STRING,
                        errorCode STRING,
                        errorMessage STRING,
                        requestParameters STRING,
                        responseElements STRING,
                        additionalEventData STRING,
                        requestId STRING,
                        eventId STRING,
                        resources ARRAY<STRUCT<ARN:STRING,accountId: STRING,type:STRING>>, 
                        eventType STRING,
                        apiVersion STRING,
                        readOnly STRING,
                        recipientAccountId STRING,
                        serviceEventDetails STRING,
                        sharedEventID STRING,
                        vpcEndpointId STRING
                    )   
                    PARTITIONED BY (region string, year string, month string, day string)
                    ROW FORMAT SERDE 'com.amazon.emr.hive.serde.CloudTrailSerde'
                    STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'com.amazon.emr.cloudtrail.CloudTrailInputFormat'
                    OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'
                    LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/';
```

Then, create the partitions individually\. You can't get results from dates that you have not created\. 

```
                    ALTER TABLE s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table_partitioned ADD
                        PARTITION (region= 'us-east-1', year= '2019', month= '02', day= '19') LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/us-east-1/2019/02/19/'
                        PARTITION (region= 'us-west-1', year= '2019', month= '02', day= '19') LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/us-west-1/2019/02/19/'
                        PARTITION (region= 'us-west-2', year= '2019', month= '02', day= '19') LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/us-west-2/2019/02/19/'
                        PARTITION (region= 'ap-southeast-1', year= '2019', month= '02', day= '19') LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/ap-southeast-1/2019/02/19/'
                        PARTITION (region= 'ap-southeast-2', year= '2019', month= '02', day= '19') LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/ap-southeast-2/2019/02/19/'
                        PARTITION (region= 'ap-northeast-1', year= '2019', month= '02', day= '19') LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/ap-northeast-1/2019/02/19/'
                        PARTITION (region= 'eu-west-1', year= '2019', month= '02', day= '19') LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/eu-west-1/2019/02/19/'
                        PARTITION (region= 'sa-east-1', year= '2019', month= '02', day= '19') LOCATION 's3://myawsexamplebucket/AWSLogs/111122223333/CloudTrail/sa-east-1/2019/02/19/';
```

You can then make the request based on these partitions, and you don't need to load the full bucket\. 

```
                    SELECT useridentity.arn,
                    Count(requestid) AS RequestCount
                    FROM s3_cloudtrail_events_db.cloudtrail_myawsexamplebucket_table_partitioned
                    WHERE eventsource='s3.amazonaws.com'
                    AND json_extract_scalar(additionalEventData, '$.SignatureVersion')='SigV2'
                    AND region='us-east-1'
                    AND year='2019'
                    AND month='02'
                    AND day='19'
                    Group by useridentity.arn
```

**Note**  
To find your Signature Version 2 requests, consider the following:  
The default setting for CloudTrail is to find only management events\. Check to ensure that you have the data events enabled for your account\.
