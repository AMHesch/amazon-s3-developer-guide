**Aborting a Multipart Upload**  

|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
| 1 |  Create an instance of an Amazon S3 client by using the [Aws\\S3\\S3Client](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.S3.S3Client.html) class [factory\(\)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.S3.S3Client.html#_factory) method\.  | 
| 2 |  Execute the [Aws\\S3\\S3Client::abortMultipartUpload\(\)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.S3.S3Client.html#_abortMultipartUpload) method\. You must provide a bucket name, a key name, and the upload ID, in the `array` parameter's required keys, `Bucket`, `Key`, and `UploadId`\.  The `abortMultipartUpload()` method deletes any parts that were uploaded to Amazon S3 and frees up the resources\.  | 

**Example of Aborting a Multipart Upload**  
The following PHP code example demonstrates how you can abort a multipart upload in progress\. The example illustrates the use of the `abortMultipartUpload()` method\. For information about running the PHP examples in this guide, go to [Running PHP Examples](UsingTheMPphpAPI.md#running-php-samples)\.  

```
 1. <?php
 2. 
 3. // Include the AWS SDK using the Composer autoloader.
 4. require 'vendor/autoload.php';
 5. 
 6. $bucket = '*** Your Bucket Name ***';
 7. $keyname = '*** Your Object Key ***';
 8. 
 9. // Instantiate the client.
10. $s3 = S3Client::factory();
11. 
12. // Abort the multipart upload.
13. $s3->abortMultipartUpload(array(
14.     'Bucket'   => $bucket,
15.     'Key'      => $keyname,
16.     'UploadId' => 'VXBsb2FkIElExampleBlbHZpbmcncyBtExamplepZS5tMnRzIHVwbG9hZ',
