Amazon S3 provides the DELETE API \(see [DELETE Object](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html)\) for you to delete one object per request\. To learn more about object deletion, see [Deleting Objects](DeletingObjects.md)\. 

You can use the REST API directly or use the wrapper libraries provided by the AWS SDKs that can simplify your application development\.
